  I always want to transfer from sublime to vscode, and I have changed several times in the middle. Later, it is because some convenient plug-ins[cssrem](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cipchk.cssrem) or functions fail to find good solutions on vscode.

For example, although the vscode has a plug-in on the top of the cow, there is one of the biggest drawbacks:

  <code>
    div {
      font-size: .4rem
    }
  </code>
  When you come back to adjust the time, you have forgotten how many PX set up at that time, and the hard to open the UE file to see?

### solution:
  ##### windows OS
    ```
      C:\Users\Administractor\.vscode\extensions\cipchk.cssrem-0.0.3\out\src\process.js
    ```
  ##### Replace this file
